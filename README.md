#### (Frequently updated)
Node JS, React and MongoDB based web-application, simulating an ecommerce website. The web app lets users sell their items to other users and buying items from other users. 
The website is deployed to [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).
The payment system is provided through [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).
Since there is no paid Stripe subscription linked to the project and the payment infrastructure, I highly discourage anyone from entering valid card credentials to the website.
To carry out a payment use one of the [test cards](https://stripe.com/docs/testing) provided by Stripe.
